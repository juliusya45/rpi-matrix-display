### Building Your Own Display

Don't have a Raspberry Pi or RGB matrix yet? No worries! Feel free to mess around with emulation and come back to this section once you're ready.

**Parts List**

- [Adafruit 64x64 RGB LED Matrix - 2.5mm Pitch - 1/32 Scan](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3649)
- [Adafruit RGB Matrix Bonnet for Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3211)
- [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) (or newer)
- Any microSD card
- [5V 10A Power Supply Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HCS1X66)

I also 3d printed a [matrix stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3781875) and a [pi mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2732552) for my [own build](https://imgur.com/a/64x64-album-art-matrix-backside-AjrOa5e).

Once you have all the parts, expand and proceed with the Rasperry Pi Setup below!

<summary>Raspberry Pi Setup</summary>

#### Step 1: Install Pi OS
- [Download and open the Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
    - Select your Raspberry Pi
    - Select `Raspberry Pi OS (other) - Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)`
    - Select your microSD card
- Tap "Next" and edit OS customization settings
    - Set hostname (I put matrix), set user/pass (I kept user as pi)
    - Enter wifi credentials
    - Enable ssh using password authentication
- When done, insert microSD card in pi and wait a few min for boot up

#### Step 2: Login via ssh
- `ssh pi@matrix.local`
- This puts you in the `/home/pi` directory
- You can use `pwd` to confirm where you are throughout this process

#### Step 3: Update packages and install git
- `sudo apt update` (get current list of packages)
- `sudo apt upgrade` (upgrade out of date packages)
- `sudo apt install git`

#### Step 4: Proceed with the Installation instructions above
